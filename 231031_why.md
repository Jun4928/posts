# WHY BERLIN

## Introduction

This article is about why I am moving to Berlin based on what I have experienced since the outbreak of Covid. Nothing set and fixed yet, which is why I am incredibly excited about this journey.

All I have got now writing this is the short-term housing contract in Charlottenburg, Berlin and one-way flight ticket. Plus, a resume of 3 years career as Software Engineer and Mentor.

## Why experience since Covid

Because, when Covid happened, I lost my job as a tour guide. I was supposed to go to Rome. BOOM. No flights mean no tourists. The company that hired me had ever faced this sort of issue, so they didn't know how to handle this, which put me in the breakdown. I wrote a [post](https://jun-choi-4928.medium.com/%EB%8B%A4%EC%8B%9C-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C-%EC%9D%B4%EC%95%BC%EA%B8%B0-93d639c8d21d)(Korean) about it.

Long story short, I became a Software Engineer and I have gone through 4 different companies, including start-ups and huge enough ones to get Series E, for 3 years. [For you curious about why I switched jobs](https://medium.com/@jun-choi-4928/%EB%A7%8C-2%EB%85%84%EC%9D%98-%EA%B2%BD%EB%A0%A5-%EB%84%A4-%EB%B2%88%EC%A7%B8-%ED%9A%8C%EC%82%AC-38a6aae1c7ad)(Korean)

So, you might be asking what it has got to do with moving to Berlin. Let me walk you through.


## Getting Better

Yes, getting better. **Will to get better**. Even when I suffered from anxiety and depression disorder, I was completely aware of this will. Thing is, I didn't know how to get better.

My antidote to it was getting out of the comfort zone. I took a little step, even though it seemed nothing. I tried hard not to focus on results, I got used to being in the journey of getting better, instead. 

We tend to try to accomplish something big and noticeable, but this only brings pains when not. I am not saying that we don't need a goal. What I am trying to say is set a goal and then, see and feel as a human on the way of getting closer to it.

Here's my stroy.

I started running last year. I used to do a 3k run with 5'00"/km pace, increasing my heart beat up to ZONE5(+190bpm), which is not quite enjoyable. Something felt off. I wanted to get better, so I ran, but it didn't seem to help me. I thought fast and strong runs was a signal of getting out of the comfort zone. I set a goal, getting faster and run as much as in a short amount of time. It turned out to make me in pain physically, which put me into a rabbit hole where **I DO NOT MOVE and DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET OUT**. I basically quit running.

I went through quite hard times in this summer. I thought I need a daily routine except work. So, I started running again. Thankfully, I came across a video pointing out the importance of **Slow Run**. Instead of being focused on goals like getting faster, you should see surroundings and feel your every single breathe you take and how your feet touch the ground while running.

Now, I don't give a s**t about how fast I'm running, I just care about small things during a run, such as 'how Han river beautiful is', 'I'm so grateful that I can run my life', and 'the pain on the right foot has just gone by trainings and stretching'. These all small, but they keep me running and want to run longer not faster, which is one of the ways of getting out of the comfort zone little by little. So, I got to the point where I run 3-4 times a week with a mild pace on average 5km.

There is an algorithm called **Divide and Conquer**. [The Divide and Conquer algorithm is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=578056430&rlz=1C5CHFA_enKR982KR982&sxsrf=AM9HkKkcbiSwqMevOyENTEujOaSRqrI5Gg:1698733676459&q=divide+and+conqure+algorithm&nfpr=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOu-mK1J-CAxUy3mEKHcQpCJ8QvgUoAXoECAcQAg&biw=538&bih=827&dpr=2) I like the philosophy behind it, because it applies to quite everything I do in my life. It resonates with my desire **Will to get better**.

## At workplace

In general, when you work, at least you want something better. It could be thousands and millions of kinds depending on the person. For example, higher salary, successful career, gentle and nice leaders, making products that have impact on the world and the list goes on.

After all, all comes down to communications. A workplace is a place about to crash with burning desires. The thing that glues the people at work is trust. In the process of defeating disbelieves between people, understanding the others' **Will to get better** is the key because it helps you become a human not a machine making products targeting at speed and efficiency. Human trust is built on the common sense that we all have desires. The only way to know this is by communications.
